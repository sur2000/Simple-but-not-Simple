Notes:
- This game is intended to be hard and frustrating. Try it again, keep trying it. You will understand the tips and tricks. 

- Well its not that hard. Its all about the right time to press the UP ARROW or SPACE BAR key. ENJOY!
  
- The background melody is "Goose house - Hikaru nara [Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso]"

- The obstacleSpawner is incredibly long. It definitely works though. 
  And whether you lose a few times, but you cant miss out to listen the amazing "Anime soundtrack" I have used, can you? 
  SO put on your headphones and keep playing to reach the end :)
  
Instructions: 
- You have to click the window once before start playing, but only at the start until you close the game. 

- Use SPACE BAR or UP ARROW key to jump. Well, I was very comfortable with UP ARROW. It goes smooth. 

- Current score, Highest score(until you close the window) and number of times you restart, will be shown at the top bar line. 

- If you lose at the start only (collison with spike), I assure you are not going to have 0 points ;) 
  Even then also you will be having few points, with the reference of number of seconds you were present in the game just after the start.
